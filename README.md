# granularSynthProject
GRANULAR SYNTHESISER
This synthesiser is being developed by the CAMT course. It will feature an envelope and various
effects. The envelope can be applied to various aspects of the synthesiser besides amplitude,
such as the density of the grains.

GOALS:
Trigger creation of grains WITHOUT RANDOMNESS with MIDI
Apply default ADSR values from ValueTree
Add sliders to edit these values and update ValueTree
Implement randomness
